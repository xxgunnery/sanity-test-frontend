# FOR FUN - SANITY SEEMED REALLY COOL

This repository is meant to:
- Document my learning of Sanity.io


## Learning resources:

- Kapehe Sanity.io Crash Course on YouTube ([LINK](https://youtu.be/32RP-sG1njE))

## Using this app:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/xxgunnery/sanity-test-frontend`
2. Download the packages: `yarn`
3. Start the react app: `yarn start`
4. You will need access to my Sanity project, or you can reate your own:
5. `yarn global add @sanity/cli && sanity init` to get your Sanity Studio
6. I chose a template schema, but you can do whatever you wish.
